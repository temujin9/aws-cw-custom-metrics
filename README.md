CloudWatch, which powers the alarms which scale AWS auto-scaling groups, lacks metrics for memory. This is by design: CloudWatch uses external-to-the-machine metrics only (to avoid issues with reaching into customer OSes). This microservice closes that gap, and is a good place to collect other statistics which require machine access.
